          <h2>Learning Japanese Entry #1</h2>
        </header>
        <div>

          <p>
            This is my first entry on learning Japanese. I have many more entries on the way as I progress through the language and hope to provide some useful advice that should make things more efficient for other learners.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been tracking my progress from the start and will be posting my first entries from a few months ago (hence the differences between dates of writing and the dates of upload). I'm currently about 3-4 months into my Japanese studies and am primarily
            focusing on the AJATT method of approach. If you are unaware of <abbr title="All Japanese All The Time">AJATT</abbr>, it is an immersion method that focuses mainly on input rather than output. The main 3 factors of the method are;
</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              1. 10000 hours of Japanese audio within 18 months
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Learn 10000 grammatically correct native sentences
            </li>
            <li>
              3. Surround yourself with Japanese material as much as you can
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The combination of the three have allowed a lot of people to obtain native fluency in Japanese (and other languages) within 18 months of study (including the owner of the site, Khatz). That's the
            basic outline of the method I am following. I will fill you in with more information about it as I go along as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Well that leads nicely on to this. My first entry that I made on notepad on the 8th of June 2015.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pre-existing knowledge of the Language: Some words and basic phrases from anime, Jpop and Jvloggers such as <abbr title="konnichiwa">こんにちは</abbr> (Hello)、<abbr title="ohayou">おはよう</abbr> (Good morning)、<abbr title="arigatou">ありがとう</abbr> (Thank
            you) etc but no knowledge of hiragana, katakana, kanji, grammar, sentence structure etc.
</p>

          <p>
            "8th of June 2015: Binge watched language "hacking" videos such as the TedxTalks videos on fluency in 6 months and got inspired to start learning Japanese. Previously I somehow ended up watching Jvloggers before hand (I think one of them may have been related to anime
            in someway but I have no idea) and gradually became interested in Japanese culture. Started learning hiragana and katakana on memrise. I'm not going to lie it was a bit difficult to get these obscure characters memorised but I enjoyed the
            process so it didn't bother me. I've gone over all of them so far and can write most of them from memory without having to look them up. So far so good!!"

</p>

          <p>
            I think what I might do is analyse each of these posts to show you what I did that was inefficient (for me) and what I did that was good (for me). Of course different approaches work for different people so don't take my word on anything, try it yourself and
            if it works or doesn't work, great! Your one step towards better learning either way.
</p>

          <p>
            Earlier I spoke about a method called <abbr title="All Japanese All The Time">AJATT</abbr> which I highly recommend for the hardcore Japanese learners out there, well I guess it's actually a lot easier
            than normal study, and more lazy, and more efficient, and gets you to fluency faster than any other method with as little work as possible, and... you get the idea. Highly recommended. I also spoken briefly about
            using memrise, in the diary post, to learn hiragana and katakana. Although memrise is free and can be used for both writing systems it drags the testing process out for a much longer time than needed and makes the whole thing rather tiring/boring.
            To refrain from this I would suggest using an app called Dr. Moku's mnemonics which I also used. The apps cost a few pounds but are well worth it as they really help you to remember each character.
            Alternatively you can grab yourself Anki or another free SRS and download a hiragana and katakana deck which will be just as efficient! In fact, I will be discussing similar methods for Kanji in future posts.
</p>

          <p>
           That's it for this post, I will see you next time where I discuss how to learn<abbr title="Katakana and Hiragana"><strong> Kana</strong>.</abbr>
